    description: >-
      Delete indices matching the prefix filebeat in excess of
      30GB of data , starting with the oldest indices, based on index creation_date.
      An empty index list (from no indices being in excess of the size limit, for
      example) will not generate an error.

    description: >-
      Delete indices older than 2 days (based on index name), for tomcat-

      actionable list of indices (ignore_empty_list) and exit cleanly.
